         * Different classes for: 
         * 1. Deck
         * 2. Dealer
         * 3. Player
         * 4. Program (main method, communicate with the player)
         * (maybe a separate class for Hand? containing the cards currently in hand)
         * (maybe a gameController class also?? we'll see)
         * 
         * The deck class should take 2 Enums to work with:
         * one for the numbers + jack, queen, king, ace and one for Suit ♠♥♦♣
         * 
         * Program logic:
         * fill the 52? card deck using for cycles?
         * deal the cards to dealer and player (need to take the cards out of the list so they wouldnt repeat)
         * display the dealt hands for player and dealer(second card hidden for dealer)
         * ask (cycle) the user what they want to do next (1 to hit, 2 to reveal/end)
         * if hit again, deal another card from our deck (but what about house??? - hit aswell when user hits?, hmm...)
         * if end, decide the winner and reveal the results
         *
